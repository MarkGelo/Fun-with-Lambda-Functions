# Scripts
Made scripts that I find useful or interesting to learn/make. Some are deployed in AWS Lambda to run on a schedule using AWS CloudWatch Events.

# Reddit-Notify
Given a word or phrases, searches through subreddits looking for matches and sends an email with the resulting thread accompanied with comments having more upvotes than what the user specified. I set it up so this script gets run once a day.

# Twitter/Tumblr Bot
Will tweet/post a random frame from Tom and Jerry Classics every 30 minutes.

# Card Scraping
Scrapes through json files and websites for card information and images to potentially use for a Discord bot. Currently, only using Pokemon cards which allows users to collect and trade over 21 thousand pokemon cards using [Munch](https://top.gg/bot/717368969102622770) bot in Discord.
