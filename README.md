# Scripts
Made scripts that I find useful or interesting to learn/make. Some are deployed in AWS Lambda to run on a schedule.

# Reddit-Notify
Given a query, searches through subreddits looking for matches and sends an email with the resulting thread accompanied with comments having more upvotes than what the user specified. I set it up so this script gets run once a day.
