# Scripts
Made scripts that I find useful or interesting to learn/make. Some are deployed in AWS Lambda to run on a schedule.

# Reddit-Notify
Given a query, searches through subreddits looking for matches and sends an email with the resulting thread accompanied with comments having more upvotes than what the user specified. I set it up so this script gets run once a day.

# Twitter/Tumblr Bot (Tom and Jerry Screens)
Will tweet/post a random frame from Tom and Jerry Classics every 30 minutes.
